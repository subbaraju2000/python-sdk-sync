# Installation:

To install the SDK, you can use pip:

```bash
pip3 install python_sync_api
```

# Basic Usage:

## Importing the SDK

```python
from python_sync_api.client import VideoSDKClient
```

# Initialization:

Initialize the FastPix SDK with your API credentials.

```python
from python_sync_api.client import VideoSDKClient

client = VideoSDKClient(username="your-access-token-id", password="your-secret-key")
```

## Example Usage:

Below is an example of configuring `FastPix Python SDK` into your project.

```python
from python_sync_api.client import VideoSDKClient
 
client = VideoSDKClient(username=username, password=password)
      
try:
    media = client.media.get_all()
    print("Media:", media)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching media: {str(e)}")
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# Usage:

## 1. Media Operations:

### 1.1. Media Uploads:

#### Upload Media from a URL:

Use the `client.media.create_pull_video` method to upload media directly from a URL. For detailed configuration options, refer to the [Create media from URL](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/create-media) API documentation.

```python
# Define the request payload for uploading media from a URL.
mediaFromUrlRequest = {
"inputs": [{
  "type": "video", # Specifies the type of media being uploaded (e.g., "video").
  "url": "https://static.fastpix.io/sample.mp4" # URL of the media file to be uploaded.
 }],
"metadata": {
  "video_title": "Big_Buck_Bunny" # Metadata to associate with the media, such as its title.
},
"accessPolicy": "public", # Access policy for the media ("public" or "private").
"maxResolution": "1080p"
}

media_response = client.media.create_pull_video(mediaFromUrlRequest)
print("media_response", media_response)
```

#### Upload Media from a Local Device:

Use the `client.media.get_presigned_url` method to obtain a `signedUrl` and upload media directly from a local device. For more details on configuration options, refer to the [Upload media from device](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/direct-upload-video-media) API documentation.

```python
# Define the request payload for uploading media from a device.
mediaFromDeviceRequest = {
  "corsOrigin": "*", # Specifies the allowed origin for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). "*" allows all origins.
  "pushMediaSettings": {
    "accessPolicy": "private", # Sets the access policy for the uploaded media (e.g., "private" or "public").
    "optimizeAudio": true, # Enables audio optimization for the uploaded media.
    "maxResolution": "1080p", # Specifies the maximum resolution allowed for the uploaded media.
  },
}

mediaFromDeviceResponse = client.media.get_presigned_url(mediaFromDeviceRequest)
print("Upload Response:", mediaFromDeviceResponse)
```

### 1.2. Media Management:

#### Get List of All Media:

Use the `client.media.get_all` method to fetch a list of all media assets. You can customize the query by modifying parameters such as `limit`, `offset`, and `orderBy`. Refer to the [Get list of all media](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/list-media) API documentation for the accepted values.

```python
# Define the parameters for fetching media assets in a separate variable.
media_asset_request_params = {
    "limit": 10,  # Number of media assets to fetch in one request.
    "offset": 1,  # Starting position for the list of media assets (useful for pagination).
    "orderBy": "desc",  # Sort order for the media assets ("desc" for descending, "asc" for ascending).
}

# Assuming `client` is already initialized with the proper credentials
all_media_assets = client.media.get_all(media_asset_request_params)

# Print the fetched media assets
print("All Media Assets:", all_media_assets)
```

#### Get Media Asset by ID:

Use the `client.media.get_by_id` method to retrieve a specific media asset by its ID. Provide `mediaId`of the asset to fetch its details. Refer to the [Get a media by ID](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/get-media) API documentation for more details.

```python
media_id = "mediaId"  # Unique identifier for the media asset to be retrieved

get_media_asset = client.media.get_by_id(media_id)

# Print the retrieved media asset by ID
print("Retrieved media asset by ID:", get_media_asset)
```

#### Update Media Asset:

Use the `client.media.update` method to update metadata or other properties of a specific media asset. Provide the `mediaId` of the asset along with the metadata to be updated. Refer to the [Update a media by ID](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/updated-media) API documentation for more details.

```python
media_id = "mediaId"  # Unique identifier for the media asset to be retrieved

# Define the payload with the updates to be applied to the media asset.
update_payload = {
    "metadata": {
        "key": "value",  # Replace "key" and "value" with actual metadata keys and values
    },
}

update_media_asset = client.media.update(media_id, update_payload)

# Print the updated media asset details
print("Updated Media Asset:", update_media_asset)
```

#### Delete Media Asset:

Use the `client.media.delete` method to delete a specific media asset by its ID. Pass the `mediaId` of the asset you want to delete. Refer to the [Delete a media by ID](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/delete-media) API documentation for more information.

```python
media_id = "mediaId"  # Unique identifier for the media asset to be retrieved

# Assuming `client` is already initialized with the necessary credentials
delete_media_asset = client.media.delete(media_id)

# Print the response indicating the media asset has been deleted
print("Deleted Media Asset:", delete_media_asset)
```

#### Get Media Asset Info:

Use the `client.media.get_media_info` method to retrieve detailed information about a specific media asset. Pass the `mediaId` to fetch its details. Refer to the [Get info of media inputs](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/retrievemediainputinfo) API documentation for more details.

```python
media_id = "mediaId"  # Unique identifier for the media asset to be retrieved

getMediaInfo =  client.media.get_media_info(media_id)
print("Media Asset Info:", getMediaInfo)
```

### 1.3. Manage Media Playback:

#### Generate Media Playback ID:

Use the `client.media_playback_ids.create` method to generate a playback ID for a specific media asset. You can pass an `mediaId` and configure options such as the `accessPolicy`. For detailed configuration options, refer to the [Create a playback ID](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/create-media-playback-id) API documentation.

```python
# Define the mediaId and accessPolicy dynamically

mediaId =  "media-id", # Unique identifier for the media asset.

playbackOptions = {
  accessPolicy: "public", # Can be 'public' or 'private'.
}

playbackIdResponse = client.media_playback_ids.create(media_id=mediaId, data=playbackOptions)

print("Playback ID Creation Response:", playbackIdResponse)
```

#### Delete Media Playback ID:

Use the `client.media_playback_ids.delete()` method to delete a playback ID for a specific media asset. You need to pass both the `mediaId` and the `playbackId` to delete the playback ID. For detailed configuration options, refer to the [Delete a playback ID](https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/delete-media-playback-id) API documentation.

```python
# Define the mediaId and playbackId dynamically
media_id = "media-id"; # The ID of the media asset for which you want to delete the playback ID.
playback_ids = ["id1", "id2"]; # The playback ID that you want to delete.

deletePlaybackResponse = client.media_playback_ids.delete(media_id, playback_ids)

print("Playback ID Deletion Response:", deletePlaybackResponse)
```
